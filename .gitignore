#  .gitignore for a Python project using Weights & Biases (wandb)
# ===================================================================

# --- Weights & Biases ---
# Ignore the local wandb directory which stores run data, logs,
# artifacts, and sync files before uploading to the cloud. This can
# become very large and contains machine-specific information.

# Ignore wandb debug logs

# --- Python Virtual Environments ---
# Never commit your virtual environment. Use a requirements.txt
# or pyproject.toml file to manage dependencies instead.
